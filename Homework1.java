/*Since only one public class can be written per file in Java, it becomes difficult to manage 
 *writing homework.  You may have to write one class for one problem.
 *
 * Instead, you could write the solution for one problem in one method.  Method is a 
 * construct which allows you to write bulk of code(instructions) as a group.  So, 
 * you could simply write one public class per homework and create multiple methods, one
 * method for one exercise.
 * 
 * You can use the following template.
 * 
 * Later, when you learn Object Oriented Programming, then you can write multiple classes
 * and zip them together when you submit your work.
